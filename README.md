Anisotropic diffusion

[Wikepedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisotropic_diffusion): in image processing and computer vision, anisotropic diffusion, also called Peronaâ€“Malik diffusion, is a technique aiming at reducing image noise without removing significant parts of the image content, typically edges, lines or other details that are important for the interpretation of the image.

This package wraps the implementation provided by [Alberto Morcillo Sanz](https://github.com/MorcilloSanz) in [AnisotropicDiffusion-Image](https://github.com/MorcilloSanz/AnisotropicDiffusion-Image)
